      <p class="text1">In several cultures, cows hold religious significance and <br>
        are worshipped as symbols of abundance and fertility. They are also central to <br>
        traditions such as Hinduism’s reverence for the cow as a sacred animal. <br>

         Improving productivity of farm animals is one of the major challenges. <br>
             The average annual milk yield of Indian cattle is 1172 kg <br>
              which is only about 50% of the global average. <br>
          Indus valley civilization is the earliest known culture of the Indian subcontinent. <br>
             It developed primarily during the Chalcolithic period (3300-1300 BCE). <br>
              Most of the sites belonging to this period have been excavated from modern day- India and Pakistan. <br>

Harappa and Mohenjodaro were the two great cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, <br>
 emerging around 2600 BCE along the Indus River Valley in the Sindh and <br>
  Punjab provinces of Pakistan. Their discovery and excavation in the 19th and <br>
   20th centuries provided important archaeological data regarding the civilization’s <br>
    architecture, technology, art, trade, transportation, writing, and religion. <br>
cow, in common parlance, a domestic bovine, regardless of sex and age, usually of <br>
 the species Bos taurus. In precise usage, the name is given to mature females of <br>
  several large mammals, including cattle (bovines), moose, elephants, sea lions, and whales. <br>

Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world, and the English language <br>
 has several words to describe these animals at various ages. A baby cow is called a calf. <br>
  A female calf is sometimes called a heifer calf and a male a bull calf. A heifer is a <br>
  female that has not had any offspring. The term usually refers to immature females; after <br>
   giving birth to her first calf, however, a heifer becomes a cow. An adult male is known as a bull. <br>
    Many male cattle are castrated to reduce their aggressive tendencies and make them more tractable. <br> 
    Young neutered males, which are primarily raised for beef, are called steers or bullocks, <br>
     whereas adult neutered males, which are usually used for draft purposes, are known as oxen.  <br>
      A group of cows, cattle, or kine (an archaic term for more than one cow) constitutes a herd. <br>
       English lacks a gender-neutral singular form, and so “cow” is used for both female  <br>
       individuals and all domestic bovines. <br>
